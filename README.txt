ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is about creating a somewhat complicated text game that is both useable and fun to play.
Dungeon Escape has the premise of a party of people beimng stuck in a dungeon after being trapped by a sorcerer.
The main point of the game is to escape the dungeon, clear all rooms, find keys and treasures and keep as many team members alive in the proccess.
The game has more to it too as you clash with monsters and encounter interesting NPCs along your journey.
While there are endless complexities that can be added the game is already very fun to play as it tracks your progress along the way!
